I am from India. Main area of my expertise is Web-development. Building websites and Web applications of different complexity, from simple representational sites in plain HTML to various difficult projects based on frameworks or custom solutions.
In past years I've been writing code in the following technologies and tech support:

✅ API Integration
✅ Facebook api, youtube api, instagram, wepay,stripe Integration
✅ Twilio API Integration
✅ One signal api
✅ Node
✅ React
✅ Angular
✅ Vue
✅ Laravel
✅ WordPress
✅ Shopify
✅ Javascript(jQuery)/Html/CSS
✅ git/svn/Bitbucket
✅ Python/Django
✅ React Native

I develop products rather than some Web Apps or website so if you are looking for a developer who deliver more than just writing code for you, you are at the right place.

Among my skills, I would point out problem-solving, analytic thinking, out of the box thinking and I have great research skills.
Kind Regards
Deepak Kumar
